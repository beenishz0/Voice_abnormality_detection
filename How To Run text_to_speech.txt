# Generating Synthetic Data 

Generating synthetic speech data for 100+ different people reading the Rainbow passage can be done in several way. 
We decided to use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API 
Google Cloud provides a high-quality Text-to-Speech API that supports multiple voices, languages, and accents, which will give you diverse voice recordings. 

Below are the steps, we followed to generate the synthetic dataset: 

1) Set up Google Cloud: 

Create a Google Cloud account if you don’t have one here. 

Enable the Text-to-Speech API in the Google Cloud Console. 

Create an API key to authenticate requests.  

key=API_KEY 

Install Google Cloud Client Library: You need to install the Google Cloud TTS client library in Python. 

pip install google-cloud-texttospeech 

You might need to install google_cloud_sdk , which can be done as follows on Ubuntu OS: 

sudo snap install google-cloud-sdk --classic 
check it is installed: gcloud –version 

2) Use the provided text_to_speech.py python script to Generate Speech
Make sure to set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable in the script correctly to your local credentials file. 

3) What the script does: 

Voices: It uses different voices from Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API. 

100 Audio Files: It generates 100 audio files in the .wav format, each with a different voice. 

Output Folder: All generated files are saved in the generated_audio folder. 

4) Running the script: 

Save the script as text_to_speech.py. 

Set up your Google Cloud credentials and run the script: 

python3 text_to_speech.py
